          Purple is a DAO whose goal is to proliferate and expand the Farcaster protocol and
          ecosystem. We will fund small grants via{' '}
          <FrameLink href="https://rounds.wtf/purple">Rounds.wtf</FrameLink> and larger on-chain
          proposals which proliferate Farcaster and/or build on top of the protocol.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-medium pb-2">How do I participate?</p>
        <p className="pb-7">
          There are two levels of participation: DAO Members & the Purple Community.
          <br />
          <br />
          You become a DAO Member by purchasing a{' '}
          <FrameLink href={`https://nouns.build/dao/base/${DAO_CONFIG.token}`}>
            Purple
          </FrameLink>{' '}
          token at Auction. DAO members have a governance vote, can submit proposals, and can vote
          on Rounds.wtf grants.
          <br />
          <br />
          You are a Purple Community member if you{' '}

          , build on the protocol, cast about the DAO or help propose, organize, and execute on
          small grants and proposals.
          <br />
          <br />
          Purple is a permissionless DAO â€“ all you need to do is organize your squad and make
          something happen.

        <p>
          Once the auction was started on October 25, 2022, it will run forever. A new Purple token
          is put up for auction every 24 hours.

          What is the relationship between Farcaster & Purple?
        </p>
        <p className="pb-7">
          Purple is an independent ecosystem DAO. Our goal is to proliferate and expand the
          Farcaster protocol and ecosystem. Our treasury will be used to fund those kinds of
          projects. We have no governance rights to the Farcaster protocol or client.
          <br />
          <br />
          <FrameLink href="https://merklemanufactory.com/">Merkle Manufactory</FrameLink> is the
          company behind the Farcaster protocol and official client, Warpcast.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have (permissionlessly) allocated 10% of our token to farcaster.eth, which is owned by
          Merkle Manufactory, as a good stewards of both the Farcaster protocol and Purple. <br />
          <br />
          <span className="italic">
            tldr; there is no official connection to the company that makes Farcaster, this is a
            permissionless builder DAO on top of an open protocol.
          </span>
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-medium pb-2">Can I donate to the Purple treasury on an L2?</p>
        <p>
          Sure! Many partners, artists, farcasters and other projects have donated a % of their
          transactions to Purple so that we can continue to fund Farcaster Public Goods. You can
          only donate on Base and the treasury address is
          0xd1a84b374fd0b9466c1e99ddce15dc6179c8376a.
