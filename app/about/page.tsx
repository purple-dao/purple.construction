          What is the relationship between Farcaster & Purple?
        </p>
        <p className="pb-7">
          Purple is an independent ecosystem DAO. Our goal is to proliferate and expand the Farcaster
          protocol and ecosystem. Our treasury will be used to fund those kinds of projects. We have
          no governance rights to the Farcaster protocol or client.

          <a href="https://merklemanufactory.com/" target="_blank">
            Merkle Manufactory
          </a>{' '}
          is the company behind the Farcaster protocol and official client, Warpcast.
          <br />
          <br />
          We have (permissionlessly) allocated 10% of our token to farcaster.eth, which is owned by
          Merkle Manufactory, as a good stewards of both the Farcaster protocol and Purple. <br />
          <br />
          <span className="italic">
            tldr; there is no official connection to the company that makes Farcaster, this is a
            permissionless builder DAO on top of an open protocol.
